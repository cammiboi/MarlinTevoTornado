# Marlin 1.19 for Tevo Tornado
Marlin 1.19 Firmware for the Tevo Tornado 3D Printer

This is for a stock printer using the stock "MKS GEN L" control board

# My Printer Modifications in this branch
* Switched extruder output E0 and E1 - TODO switch this back again!
* Changed the x bed size to 300 mm to prevent the hotend from going over the edge of the bed
* Enabled mesh bed leveling via LCD panel
